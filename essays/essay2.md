## As a Tool

"Javascript", at first glance seems to be a very scary thing. However, who would of thought that appending "-script" to
the word bring chills to the average and beginning learner, because in reality, it is far less scarier than Java itself.
With less of the "beef" (libraries) that comes with Java, I think Javascript is a very powerful lanuguage that can be used to 
compile and program quickly. I've used Java, C, C++, Python before, and I would describe Javascript as the little kid brother of Java,
with less of the hassle. 

For example:

<pre>
	void Java {
		construcotr(int status, int update){
    ...
    }
	}

	function JavaScript() {  <- where did those integers go?
		constructor(status, update){
    ...
    }
	}
</pre>


For the seasoned programmer, Javascript is just a tool and cannot be used solely for development, as it is mostly useful for the
front-end design aspect of programming, such as websites. The back-end is where the other programming lanugages come in. 


## You Got to Work At It

Learning is a repetitive process and nothing else annoys you more than a persistent mosquito that always comes back to you. 
Like the mosquito, ICS 314 pushes students to keep a steady learning process to ensure retainability and effiency in student academic
work. With resources and information uploaded online, which also includes lecutures and practice, LOTS OF PRACTICE. 

With ICS 314 introducing a thing called a WOD (Workout Of the Day), we are trained and assessed on a problem weekly such that it 
is difficult to forget what we are learning about. Like the average gym goer, we are training are "brain-muscles" 3 times a week
or even more to learn the material. I think that this type of teaching style has a very effective metallity when it comes to teaching, 
which in turn helps the students.

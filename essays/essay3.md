Many students, including myself may have struggled one time or another to figure out homework problems in the quickest manner possible, who better than to ask the professor or the teacher’s assistant. Like many students before us, they have heard the same question in one form or another over there course of their education and their teaching careers. When asking a question to them, in some cases they are happy to answer our questions, but most of the time they smile and ask you to trace it.  In the field of computer science, helping each other to learn no matter the difference of the experience level is one of the greatest parts about computer science as a whole, however, it is up to the learner to ask it. 

Asking questions is all in the process of learning, however as software engineers, asking the smart questions will get you far in the long run.  In the beginning of a young programmers career, he/she may get by by asking simple questions and has the availability to google previous instance of similar problems to get their answers. As homework or a task gets difficult, everyone, almost every time, runs across the word “help” in their mind. We begin to think, “WHO” is going to help  and “WHAT” to ask, but not so often “HOW” to ask it and “WHY” it’s being asked . 

A closer look of how formulating questions are important can be observed in the website, StackOverflow, where we can observe how asking the right questions can help the programmer. (Stack Overflow also has a guideline in helping to form a “good”/”smart” question.)

An example: How do I make my swap function in java if there is no method by which we can pass by reference? Could somebody give me a code?The change wont be reflected back since java passes by value
 
<pre>
with given code 

swap(int a, int b)
{
     int temp = a;
     a = b;
     b = temp;
}

A fairly simple question for the beginner programmer.
However, never really clearly states the purpose, 
thus making people who are trying to help to 
potentially ask him/her questions. 

</pre>

Given any situation, asking the right questions not only saves a lot of time for everyone, but also it is very sincere gesture, especially when the person with a question takes the time to fully understand the problem, rather than to ask the first thing that comes to the person's head.

## It's A Glorified Tool
When I was first introduced to Semantic UI, I thought it was nothing more but a glorified styler, a tool to fix up margins, add paddings, a help to arrange menu items, etc. After spending some time and working with it for a while, i noticed all the subtle benefits that comes when learning this framework. 

Altogether, I would sum up that there are two benefits that come from learning and practing semantic ui. 

1. It saves a lot of time. For example: it makes the pain of arrange all the details of margins less of hassle.
2. Easy to define and implement, thus making a good portion of it easier to learn. 


## Easy to learn

In terms of formmatting, such as menu bars, arranging each html markup tag ("<div class....>")  can be a pain from all the details that come from developing a real website. With semantic ui, margins and formatting become less of a hassle because of the class properties within the tags. From practicing with semantic, I still have to consider what I have add in using html, but also if it is feasable to use the css file to help arrange fonts, sizes of text, and so on. Considering the full potential of semantic ui, I think that it does save time, despite only having a week to work on it. 

## Using semantic class
Like using class in the tags for html, it simple to implement when you just append "ui" at the beginning of the class name. 

SEMANTIC UI example:

```
<image class="ui image item" src= "image_source"></image>

```
HTML example:
```
<img class="proj-img" src="image_source"/></image>
```
It is a subtle difference, but most importantly how well the class discription with semantic ui plays an important role in formatting, where the words "image" and "item" is very important. Despite the extra length of words, it is easy to understand and does not reallly have an affect with the length of time learning this framework.


## Summary

Comparing the two together, using css to format the class of the item within it, gives more control to the writer than including it with semantic ui. Some may say it doesn't make a difference when you know a strong percentage of html and css so it generally up to the writer, and I couldn't agree more. Using the semantic ui framework has not been much of a difference between the lenghth of consideration of formatting, editing, and test. In a few words the semantic ui is best described as a little helper.
